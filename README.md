Tracking home improvement tasks. Probably no code necessary.

**See https://github.com/Steven-Eardley/housework/projects for ongoing efforts. Create issues, label and add them to a month's project to schedule a task.**

*note: this is a public repository - avoid inserting proprietary information into this tracker.*
